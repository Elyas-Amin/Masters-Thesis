# Masters Thesis - Coherence Models and Data Modifications

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data used for my master's thesis on coherence models and data modifications. The project involves extracting, transforming, and analyzing text data from various sources, particularly focusing on the GCDC dataset. The repository is structured to support efficient data management and model development.

## Repository Structure

### Root Directory

- **`LICENSE`**: The license file for the project.
- **`Masters-Thesis.iml`**: Project configuration file.
- **`README.md`**: The file you're reading right now.

### `CoherenceModels/`
This directory is intended to contain scripts and notebooks related to the coherence models used or developed in this thesis.

### `Data/`
This directory contains all the data-related files and directories.

#### `GCDC/`
- **`GCDCParquet/`**: Contains Parquet files generated from JSONL files for efficient data access and storage.
  - **`GCDC.parquet`**: The combined Parquet file containing all the data extracted from the JSONL files.
- **`JSONLFiles/`**: Contains the original `.jsonl` files from which the data was extracted.

#### `DataModifications/`
Contains scripts and modules used for data extraction, combination, and modification, and preprocessing.

- **`__pycache__/`**: Stores Python bytecode files. These can be safely ignored or deleted if not needed.
  
- **`scripts/`**: Contains the Python scripts used for various data operations.
  - **`CombineJSONLFilesToParquet.py`**: The `CombineJSONLFilesToParquet.py` script can be used to extract and combine data from JSONL files into a Parquet file. This script only needs to be run once unless the underlying data changes.

  ```bash
  cd DataModifications/scripts
  python CombineJSONLFilesToParquet.py
  ```

  - **`DeleteFactsColumn.py`**: This script removes the `facts` column from the Parquet file if it exists.

  ```bash
  cd DataModifications/scripts
  python DeleteFactsColumn.py
  ```


- **`__init__.py`**: Marks the `DataModifications` directory as a Python package.

- **`DataModifications.py`**: Contains the `DataExtraction` class, which is responsible for extracting and combining data from JSONL files into Parquet format.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and Parquet file handling.
- **PyArrow** or **FastParquet**: For Parquet support in Pandas.

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas pyarrow
```

### Additional Notes

- `__pycache__` Directories: These directories contain Python bytecode compiled files. They are automatically generated by Python and can be ignored or deleted if needed.
- Project Configuration: The project uses a virtual environment (myenv) for managing dependencies.
